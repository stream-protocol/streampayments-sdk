To expand the **Stream**Payments SDK to support different currencies, wallet features, and blockchain networks, developer need to make several enhancements and additions. Here's a high-level outline of the steps involved:

### 1. Currency Support

#### a. Define Token Types

You'll need to define token types for each supported currency, both cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. For example:

```javascript
const TOKEN_TYPES = {
  SOL: 'SOL',
  STRM: 'STRM',
  USDT: 'USDT',
  EURC: 'EURC',
  USDC: 'USDC',
  // Add more currencies as needed
};
```

#### b. Mint Addresses

Maintain a mapping of token mint addresses for each currency:

```javascript
const TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESSES = {
  [TOKEN_TYPES.SOL]: null, // Native SOL transfer
  [TOKEN_TYPES.STRM]: 'STRM_MINT_ADDRESS',
  [TOKEN_TYPES.USDT]: 'USDT_MINT_ADDRESS',
  [TOKEN_TYPES.EURC]: 'EURC_MINT_ADDRESS',
  [TOKEN_TYPES.USDC]: 'USDC_MINT_ADDRESS',
  // Add more mint addresses as needed
};
```

#### c. Currency Parameter

Modify the `sendPayment` method to accept a `currency` parameter to specify the currency type for the transaction.

### 2. Wallet Features

#### a. Fee Wallet

Extend the (Merchant) fee wallet feature to allow users to specify a fee wallet for fee transfers. Ensure that the fee wallet is also compatible with the chosen currency.

#### b. Multi-Wallet Support

Adding multi-wallet support to allow users to manage and switch between different wallets easily.

### 3. Blockchain Network

#### a. Configuration

Allow users to configure the **Stream**Payments SDK for different blockchain networks (e.g., Mainnet, Testnet, Devnet) by accepting the network URL as a parameter during initialization.

#### b. Multiple Network Support

Supporting multiple blockchain networks simultaneously icl. CirleÂ´s CCTP protocol. Developer can maintain separate instances of the **Stream**Payments SDK for different networks.

### 4. Updated Usage Example

Update the usage example to demonstrate how to use the **Stream**Payments SDK with different currencies, fee wallets, and blockchain networks. Provide examples for various scenarios.

### 5. Documentation

Documentation includes information about the supported currencies, wallet features, and blockchain networks.

### 6. Testing

Thoroughly test the **Stream**Payments SDK with different currencies, wallet configurations, and network environments to ensure reliability and correctness.

### 7. Dependency Management

Ensure that developer have the necessary dependencies for interacting with the specific blockchain networks and token contracts (e.g., Solana's `@solana/web3.js`, token program).

### 8. Error Handling

Implement robust error handling to handle currency-specific errors, network-related issues, and wallet problems gracefully.

### 9. Packaging and Distribution

Package the **Stream**Payments SDK appropriately for distribution, whether through npm or other means, and make it available for others to use.

By following these steps, developer can expand the **Stream**Payments SDK to support various currencies, wallet features, and blockchain networks, providing users with flexibility and compatibility across different cryptocurrency and stablecoin ecosystems.
